<u><b>What is GoS?</b></u><br><br>
A Game of Stones is a browser based MMORPG. A big imaginary world where people create characters and then do stuff with them.
In GoS you create a character as one of three general types then develop the character in a world based off The Wheel of Time
book series by Robert Jordan. As you may have guessed, I am a fan of the series myself (I've been thinking the whole game thing
is sort of a dead giveaway for the astute reader).
<br><br><br>

<u><b>Every time I click the find battle button it says to wait until the battle finishes!</b></u><br><br>
This is a firefox bug where your browser is (for some strange reason) deciding to load the page twice. I have found that closing all browser windows then opening
it back up again fixes the problem.
<br><br><br>


<u><b>Why don't my resources sell for as much as they are worth?</b></u><br><br>
Duh. Your broker takes 20%. ;-)<br>
Really it is to make a cost for using the system simply as a bank.
<br><br><br>

<u><b>Are there any other WoT online multiplayer games availiable?</b></u><br><br>
WoTMUD is a very different type of online multiplayer WoT game. Head over to their website and give it a try at <a href="http://www.wotmud.clan">wotmud.clan</a>.
Many fans of the series also roleplay in designated forums. <a href="http://www.dragonmount.com">Dragonmount.com</a> is one of the leading sites for RPing.
If none of these sites have what you're are looking for, check out WoTMUD's excellent <a href="http://www.wotmud.clan/directory/index.php">WoT Directory</a> for all sites WoT related.

<u><b>When I click battle I don't get a play by play and/or menus don't work</b></u><br><br>
Javascript has to be enabled for battles to work (as well as the menu). Search Google if you need help enabling javascript for your browser.
<br><br><br>

<u><b>I try to login/join and it says I don't have cookies enabled!</b></u><br><br>
You probably don't have your cookies enabled. When it told you that it also gave you a link to Google's "cookie help site".
Use that to disable cookies or allow www.gostones.net to set cookies. Or just search google for instructions specific to your browser.

<u><b>How do the dice games work?</b></u><br><br>
The games are Crowns and Tops. You can wager money which is either won or lost at the end of the round. The more players,
the greater the winnings but the lower the chances. The games are essentially the same, except Crowns uses symbols while Tops
uses regular numbered dice and includes straights.
<br>Crown=Six, Rose=Five, Sword=Four, Star=Three, Cups=Two, Rods=One.<br><br>
In the games you are trying for combinations, listed here in order of worth:<br><br>
5 of a kind<br>
4 of a kind<br>
Full house<br>
Straight (Tops only)<br>
3 of a kind<br>
2 pair<br>
1 pair
<br><br><br>

<u><b>Ok, I Joined. Now what do I do?</b></u><br><br>
These are the basic points to the game:<br>
1. Fighting<br>
2. Getting money<br>
3. Buying items<br>
4. Using 1-3 to make your character better at doing 1-2.
<br><br><br>

<u><b>How do I get money?</b></u><br><br>
Selling items and resources. You can sell items from your inventory either instantly (lower profit) or on the market,
which takes longer but gets you more money. Selling in the market allows other users to search for and purchase your item from you at the price you set.
Once put up for sale in the market the item will dissapear from your inventory and appear in your shop. Remove it from
your shop and it will go back to your inventory.
<br><br><br>

<u><b>But how do resources work?</b></u><br><br>
Ah ha! I was just getting to that. <br>The best way to increase your money is by selling and buying commodities.
The worth of commodities vary as time goes on, and each has a different characteristic. For example, the worth of goods stays
fairly level, but the worth of livestock has fairly large jumps with stable periods between. Each commodity is unique.<br>
Buying low and selling high is the name of the game. Actually, it isn't, but it could have been.
<br><br><br>

<u><b>Fighting!</b></u><br><br>
Fighting is simple! Go to a character's Bio screen and the word [battle] should be somewhere
to the lower right of the character's avatar. Click on it.<br>
The battle will now unfold before your very eyes! The win (or loss) will then go onto your permanent record, as well as adding
to your clan's rank. If you won you may have gold to pick up. If you lost, perhaps you should read up on the next two parts of this FAQ.
Battles only count towards your wins if the other character is within a few levels of you.<br>
Alternatively, you can click the "Find Battle" button on the top menu and you will randomly fight an enemy character within a few levels and find items.
<br><br><br>

<u><b>Skills</b></u><br><br>
Each character type has six unique skills. You may choose three to use at any one time. One will read 50%, the other two 25%.
This corresponds to their chances of being used in battle. As you use a skill it will gain levels. Most likely the skill
often in the 50% slot will gain levels more quickly than your other skills. You may want to try switching them around because
the higher the level of a skill the stronger it is and the more passive benefits it gives to your character, even when it is not
assigned.
<br><br><br>

<u><b>Items</b></u><br><br>
Items can be equipped or sold from a character's inventory. There are different weapon types, prefixes, and suffixes.
Each adds different damage, types of damage, and effects to your attacks. In the future there will be more equippable slots.
<br><br><br>

<u><b>Pure, Evil, or Neutral?</b></u><br><br>
This depends on your choice of skills. A fairly balanced character will be neutral, a character generally using more
Shadow affiliated skills will be evil and a character using Light affiliated skills will be Pure. This shows up both
in a character's bio and determines the color of a character's name in the World Lists. It can also be used to limit
a character's access to Clans.
<br><br><br>

<u><b>Clans? What's the point?</b></u><br><br>
Clans allow you to chat with fellow players as well as wage war on other groups of characters.
After joining a clan the World List will have an axe next to characters from enemy Clans and a horn next to memebers
of allied Clans. These enemies and allies are chosen by the clan leader. The clan leader may also choose only to allow
characters of certain affiliations to join and/or require an invitation. The clan leader may also kick troublesome clan
members.<br><br>
Any clan memeber that is inactive for more than twenty days will be ejected from the clan. Any clan leader who is inactive
for more than 5 days will loose leadership and it will pass to the character with the next highest number of wins in the clan.
<br><br><br>

<u><b>How did you do this?</b></u><br><br>
By spending way too much time on it. It was actually my first PHP project and I learned as I went. It was started 
about two years ago when I was a junior in high school and has improved a huge amount since then. I started using Notepad,
but moved to PHP Designer 2006 BETA (free) a little while ago. The majority of the code follows the coding standards of "A Big Ball of Mud".
No indents, no OOP. I get scared just thinking about altering some of my old code. Luckly my new stuff is much better, but I don't dare even start
to fix up the old stuff, which is most of the project.
<br><br><br>

<u><b>How can I donate my family fortune to this project?</b></u><br><br>
THE PAYPAL LINK!
<br><br><br>

<u><b>Hey! You copied that from me without permission!</b></u><br><br>
My appologies in advance. As far as I know I have used everything either with permission or it was free to use, but
if I made a mistake please let me know so I can either give you credit or remove the problem, which ever you prefer (I prefer the former).
Just send me a message (main page, click on Contact) and I promise to fix this as soon as I can. Sorry.
